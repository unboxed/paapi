## Sources

We have two main sources of planning application data
 - Through BoPS
 - Historical data extracted from other back office systems, exported through BI tools

The data we can extract comes from CSV files via the BI tool. This gives us enough data for our [schema](/storing-data/schema), but does not provide spatial or document data. This will need addressing in future work.

## Short term plan

For now, we will work with CSV data extracted from this method.

### Long term

We want other organisations to send us the historical data through our [Planning Application API](/api-docs).
