We looked at schemas and formats of storing [imported application data](/collecting-data), and developed a schema based on that import and data available in BOPS. We kept the software flexible enough to handle different formats.

The software can be used to Extract-Transform-Load principles to import from a variety of sources.

Where possible, we have aligned schemas and our API with the digital land [Planning Application dataset](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/dataset/planning-application/). REST versioning standards were used in the API, which allows for future change.
